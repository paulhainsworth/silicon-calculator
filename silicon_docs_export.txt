 About Silicon About Silicon  Silicon Network is a blockchain-enabled platform for GPU 
infrastructure ownership, connecting physical AI computing hardware with onchain markets. By 
providing a tokenization platform for GPUs, Silicon enables direct ownership relationships between 
individuals and professional datacenter operators.   Ask anything   Silicon's platform provides two 
core capabilities:   Tokenization: Infrastructure for datacenter partners to bring physical GPUs 
onchain as individual NFTS or fungible pool tokens  Legal Attestation & Cashflow Settlement: Legal 
and cashflow rails that bind offchain agreements and operations to onchain ownership   The name 
Silicon reflects the fundamental material of computing hardware and our mission to bring these real 
world assets (RWAs) onchain. GPU ownership represents participation in the foundational layer of 
the AI economy—Silicon provides the rails to make that ownership verifiable, transferable, and 
economically productive.  Quick links   Website: https://silicon.net (opens in a new tab)  App /

========================================

 Mission & Vision Mission & Vision  The AI revolution is being built on physical infrastructure 
controlled by a small number of corporations. Silicon's architecture enables ownership distribution 
across thousands of individual participants and dozens of independent datacenter operators. This 
distributed model reduces single points of failure, creates competitive market dynamics, and aligns 
infrastructure ownership with the broader ecosystem of AI builders and users rather than 
exclusively with large technology companies.  Democratizing AI Infrastructure Ownership  Silicon 
enables direct ownership of physical GPU hardware through blockchain verification. Our tokenization 
platform allows datacenter partners to offer their infrastructure for ownership by the broader 
public, creating paths for participation in AI infrastructure that were previously limited to 
institutional capital. By making GPU ownership accessible, Silicon distributes the economic 
benefits of AI's growth beyond hyperscaler corporations.  Creating Market Alternatives to 
Centralized Compute  Hyperscaler providers concentrate compute resources, creating opacity in 
pricing, limited availability through quotas and waitlists, and vendor lock-in that restricts 
flexibility. Silicon empowers a distributed network of independent datacenter operators to continue 
providing competitive pricing and more flexible resource allocation. This distributed model creates 
resilience through diversification while enabling market-driven price discovery for AI 
infrastructure.  Building Liquid Markets for Computing Assets  GPU hardware has historically been 
an illiquid asset class—purchasing infrastructure requires significant capital, and selling requires 
finding specialized buyers. Through tokenization, secondary marketplace infrastructure, and pooling 
protocols, Silicon transforms GPUs into tradable assets with verifiable performance history and 
transparent ownership. This liquidity enables more efficient capital allocation, allowing 
participants to enter and exit positions based on market conditions and infrastructure needs. About

 Overview Pool Token overview  Pre-deposit for pool token coming soon!  For datacenters, the pool 
token unlocks instant, global liquidity while preserving operational control and upside. For DeFi 
users, the pool token delivers diversified, real‑world yield in a single ERC‑20 with onchain USDC 
flows, NAV‑anchored redemptions, and plug‑and‑play composability across lending, yield, and liquidity. 
  The pool token is a fungible claim on a diversified basket of tokenized GPU servers  Holders will 
see value accrue to the token price from ongoing cashflows from AI workloads and residual hardware 
values  Revenue from hosted GPUs is converted to onchain USDC and deposited into the pool  Holders 
can burn pool tokens to redeem either USDC or underlying NFTs  This redemption mechanism keeps the 
spot price (on AMMs) anchored near NAV through arbitrage  Built as an ERC-20 token for 
composability with DeFi: lending, AMMs, Pendle, etc  Mission & Vision Overview

 Pages Dashboard Owner Dashboard  The Dashboard provides an at-a-glance overview of your GPU 
portfolio, earnings, and asset performance. It's your central hub for monitoring the financial 
performance of your tokenized GPU infrastructure.  Overview  Key Metrics   Balance shows available 
earnings ready to withdraw in USDC—just click "Transfer" to move funds to your wallet.  Queued 
Earnings (marked with ~) represent amounts currently processing from recently completed GPU 
rentals, typically required to queue for 30 days to account for chargebacks and late payments from 
compute customers.  Total Earnings tracks your lifetime cumulative revenue from all GPUs, including 
both withdrawn and available amounts.   Earnings Chart  This line chart visualizes your daily 
earnings over time. Filter by date range, toggle between Daily and Total views, or hover over any 
point for details. Use it to spot trends, identify performance patterns, monitor seasonal 
variations, and verify your GPUs are operating consistently.  GPUs Summary  Quick overview of your 
GPU portfolio organized by type.  Information Displayed Per GPU Type  Ownership Stats:   Owned : 
Number of GPUs you own of this type  Claim tickets : Pending GPU claims or pre-orders  Total earned 
: Cumulative earnings from this GPU type  Avg. daily earnings : Average per-GPU daily revenue  Avg. 
purchase price : Average you paid per GPU   Actions:   View [GPU Type]s : Navigate to filtered view 
showing only these GPUs   Portfolio Metrics  Total purchase cost represents your historical cost 
basis—the sum of all GPU purchase prices. Est. current value estimates your portfolio's resale value 
based on current market prices, which may differ significantly from what you originally paid.  
Sales Section  This section contains information on GPUs you have sold or are currently selling. 
Note this section will not be visible if you are not currently selling a GPU nor have you sold one 
in the past.  Currently on Sale   Shows number of GPUs actively listed  "Manage" button to edit 
listings  Quick access to sales management   Pending Payout   Amount owed from completed sales  
Action: "Contact provider to request payout"  Providers process sales payouts separately from 
rental earnings   Sold GPUs   Count of GPUs successfully sold  Total revenue from sales  Historical 
transaction record   Understanding Your Earnings  Earning States  Each earning moves through 
stages: individual rentals appear with "Queued" status, then after aging 30 days to account for 
chargebacks and payment settlement from the compute customer they aggregate into Queued Earnings 
(marked with ~ to indicate estimates) where they typically settle within 24-48 hours. Once 
processed, amounts move to your Balance where they're confirmed and ready to withdraw anytime with 
no minimum.  Why Earnings Vary  Daily fluctuations are normal. Compute demand varies by time and 
day, GPU utilization rates shift, market pricing changes, and rental duration and intensity differ. 
 Troubleshooting  Balance not updating? See if any GPUs stopped earning and review your provider's 
payout schedule. Wait for the next payout cycle. If payouts are delayed significantly, contact 
support@silicon.net  Earnings lower than expected? Check the My GPUs page for non-earning units, 
review Financials > Earnings for daily breakdowns, compare to Network > Earnings for current market 
rates, and look for "Agreement must be signed" warnings. Sign any pending agreements and contact 
your provider about underperforming GPUs.  Can't withdraw balance? Ensure your wallet is connected 
on the correct network (Base), there are no pending transactions. Try reconnecting your wallet and 
retrying the withdrawal. Overview My GPUs

 Pages My GPUs My GPUs  View and manage all your owned GPUs, monitor individual performance, handle 
agreements, and manage GPU sales.  Filtering and Search   Click provider names to filter by 
datacenter (Pantheon Compute, FarmGPU, etc.)—you can select multiple providers and see active filter 
chips.  Filter by GPU type (4090, 5090, H200) to narrow down to specific models, or search by GPU 
ID to find specific units quickly.  Use Filter for advanced options and Select to multi-select GPUs 
for bulk actions.   GPU States  Your GPUs can be in one of four states:  Agreement Required : The 
card shows a blurred GPU image with a document icon and warning. Your provider requires a signed 
agreement before earnings can begin. Click "Review agreement" to read the terms and sign 
electronically—confirmation is usually instant. Sign these immediately after purchase.  Active and 
Earning : Clear GPU image with green indicators showing total earnings, "Live since" date, GPU ID, 
provider, and type badge. No action needed—your GPU is operational, being rented to compute 
customers, and generating earnings normally. Monitor earnings regularly and compare to similar GPUs 
on the Network page.  Claim Ticket : Shows a GPU image with "Claim ticket" indicator and "Live by" 
date. You own the NFT but the physical GPU hasn't been delivered or paired yet. Monitor the 
expected delivery date and contact your provider if it passes. No action needed before delivery.  
Listed for Sale : Displays list price and "Listed on" date. Your GPU is actively listed on the 
marketplace and still generating earnings while listed. Monitor for sale completion, update the 
listing price if needed, or remove the listing if you change your mind.  🚫 GPUs cannot generate 
earnings until provider agreements are signed. Sign agreements immediately after purchase to start 
earning.  Troubleshooting a Non-Earning GPU  If GPU stops earning:    Check agreement status   Look 
for agreement warning  Sign if required     Verify GPU is live   Check "Live since" date exists  
Not a claim ticket     Contact provider   If issue persists for more a majority of a billing 
period, contact your provider  Provide GPU ID  Request status check     For Sale Tab  Currently 
Listed GPUs  Information Displayed:   GPU image and specifications  List price  Time on market   
Actions:   Manage : Edit listing, change price, or delist  View : See marketplace listing page   
Sales Best Practices  Price strategically: Check the Network page for comparable sales, factor in 
remaining GPU lifespan and total earnings to date, then price competitively for faster sales.  
While listed, your GPU continues earning and you keep those earnings until the sale completes.  
Bulk Actions  Selecting Multiple GPUs   Click "Select" button  Checkboxes appear on GPU cards  
Select desired GPUs  Choose bulk action   Available Bulk Actions:   List GPUs for sale   GPU 
Performance Comparison  Comparing Your GPUs  Within My GPUs:   Sort by "Total earnings"  Identify 
top and bottom performers  Check "Live since" dates (newer = less total earnings)  Calculate daily 
average for fair comparison   Against Network:   Note your GPU type and provider  Go to Network > 
Earnings  Find comparable GPUs  Compare your earnings to network average   Understanding GPU 
Identifiers  GPU IDs like #274-ffe9 or #02 consist of a sequential number from your provider and 
sometimes a hash fragment for unique identification. These IDs provide traceability to specific 
hardware.  Use your GPU ID to reference units in support requests, compare performance over time, 
identify specific GPUs in financial reports, and match to provider systems. IDs also help you 
confirm ownership, verify earnings attribution, match to NFT metadata, and maintain an audit trail. 
 Provider Information  Your provider is the datacenter operator who hosts your physical GPU, 
manages hardware operations, facilitates compute rentals, processes earnings, and maintains uptime. 
 Providers handle hardware deployment and maintenance, ensure uptime and connectivity, manage 
hardware failures and replacements, track GPU utilization, calculate and process earnings, provide 
reporting, define operational terms, and handle legal compliance.  Troubleshooting  GPU not 
showing? Verify the correct wallet is connected, the NFT transfer completed, page data is 
refreshed, and the GPU isn't filtered out. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet, 
refreshing the page, and clearing filters.  Can't sign agreement? Check your wallet connection, 
ensure you're on the correct network (Base or Chia per provider), enable browser pop-ups, and 
confirm you have sufficient gas for the transaction. Switch networks or add gas funds if needed.  
Earnings not matching expected? Check the "Live since" date (GPU may be recently deployed), compare 
to Network averages, verify your agreement is signed, and look for provider issues. Calculate your 
daily average, compare to benchmarks, and contact your provider if significantly low.  Claim ticket 
overdue? If the "Live by" date has passed, check for provider updates, review purchase 
communications, contact your provider for status, and document the delay. Request an ETA, 
understand the reason, and consider remedies if the delay is excessive.  Tips for Success    Sign 
agreements immediately after purchase. Keep records of signed agreements and always review terms 
before signing.    When monitoring performance, compare apples to apples—same GPU type and similar 
timeframes. Account for seasonality since compute demand varies, check the Network page to 
understand market-wide trends, and track daily averages rather than total earnings for more 
reliable metrics.    Keep your portfolio healthy. Diversify across providers with different 
specialties, mix GPU types for different workloads, monitor utilization (GPUs should earn most 
days), and plan for the hardware lifecycle since GPUs depreciate over time.    GPU performance 
varies based on market demand for compute. Consistent monitoring helps identify issues early and 
optimize your portfolio. Dashboard Financials

========================================

 Pages Financials Financials  Track your earnings, review transaction history, and understand your 
GPU portfolio's financial performance.  Earnings Tab  View detailed earning records for every GPU 
transaction.  What You'll See  Each row shows one earning event: the date the rental occurred, GPU 
type (RTX 4090, H100, etc.), provider, GPU ID (#243, #274-ffe9, etc.), and earnings amount.  
Filtering Your Data  Use custom ranges to compare month-over-month and analyze seasonal patterns. 
Filter by provider to see how each datacenter performs and identify which consistently generates 
more rentals. Compare GPU types (like RTX 4090s versus H100s) to decide which hardware to buy more 
of. Search by GPU ID or date to find specific transactions.  Earnings Chart  The line chart at the 
top shows your daily earnings—hover over any point for exact amounts and dates. Look for steady 
upward trends (healthy, growing portfolio), sudden drops (investigate which GPUs stopped earning), 
spikes (high-demand days, normal), or flat lines (potential provider issues).  Export Your Data  
Click Export to download a CSV with all visible transactions for tax preparation, accounting 
software imports, creating your own analyses, or sharing with financial advisors.  Filter before 
exporting to get exactly the data you need. Exports include all currently visible rows.  
Transactions Tab  Complete history of all money movement—earnings coming in, withdrawals going out, 
and any GPU sale proceeds.  Transaction Types   Payouts (green badge) are earnings deposited from 
your provider to your wallet.  Sales (teal badge) represent proceeds from selling GPU NFTs, moving 
from the buyer's wallet to yours.  Withdrawals (blue badge, negative amount) show funds you moved 
out to external addresses or exchanges.   What Each Row Shows  Each transaction displays the date, 
type (Payout/Sale/Withdrawal), amount (withdrawals shown as negative), source and destination 
addresses or provider names, a transaction identifier, and a "View" link to see on-chain details in 
the block explorer.  Filtering and Finding Transactions  Active filters appear just below the 
serach bar, click the X to remove them. Filter by type to see only payouts (income), withdrawals 
(spending), or sales (GPU exits). Use the date picker to narrow down to specific months or 
quarters, or set min/max amounts to find large transactions.  Search by transaction ID, wallet 
address, or specific dates. Sort by newest first (default), oldest first (historical review), or 
highest amount to find big transactions.  ⚠️ Earnings shown in Financials are actual, confirmed 
amounts. Dashboard shows both confirmed (Balance) and pending (Queued). They won't always match. My 
GPUs Calculator 


========================================
## owner pages dropdown > calculator
URL: https://docs.silicon.net/owner-pages-dropdown/calculator
========================================

 Pages Calculator Calculator  Model different scenarios to understand how variables like revenue 
decay, service life, and resale value affect your GPU returns.  ⚠️ Disclosure : This tool performs 
mathematical calculations based on historical data and user-provided assumptions. Results are 
hypothetical scenarios for educational purposes only. Past performance does not predict future 
results . Silicon Network provides no guidance on appropriate assumptions.  How It Works  The 
Calculator lets you play with variables to see how they impact return scenarios.  Two modes:   
Generic scenario - Pick any GPU type, enter assumptions, see scenario  Your GPU - Select one of 
your actual GPUs, adjust variables, compare to reality   Setting Up a Scenario  Step 1: Select GPU  
Option A: Generic Choose "Select a GPU to begin" and pick any GPU type to model a hypothetical 
purchase.  Option B: Your GPU  Choose one of your actual GPUs from the dropdown (shows as "FarmGPU 
50... #34 - gh78" or similar). The calculator will pre-fill with your real data.  Step 2: Purchase 
Price  Enter what you paid (or would pay) for the GPU.  For generic scenarios: Use current market 
prices  For your GPU: Pre-filled with your actual purchase price  Step 3: Daily Revenue  Starting 
point:  Set what the GPU earns per day right now.  Finding a realistic number:   Check your GPU on 
My GPUs page for current average  Look at Network > Earnings page for market rates  Use your actual 
history if you own similar GPUs   Step 4: Monthly Revenue Decay  GPU earnings typically decline as 
newer hardware comes out. Use the slider (0% to 20%) to set the rate: 0% means earnings stay flat 
forever (unrealistic), 3-5% indicates slow decline (optimistic), 6-10% shows moderate decline 
(realistic), and 15-20% represents fast decline (pessimistic). At 5% monthly decay, a GPU earning 
$15/day in Month 1 would earn ~$14.25 in Month 2, ~$13.54 in Month 3, etc.  Step 5: Service Term  
How long until the GPU is retired or sold? The slider ranges from 0 to 36 months, with your 
selected GPU's term marked if applicable. Hardware is typically useful for 24-36 months. Shorter 
terms mean conservative modeling while longer terms are optimistic but potentially unrealistic.  
Step 6: Residual Value  What percentage of your purchase price will you get back when selling the 
GPU at end of service? Use the slider (0% to 100%) where 0% means worthless at end (worst case), 
20-30% shows significant depreciation (realistic), 50% means reasonably holding value (optimistic), 
and 70%+ is very optimistic. Reality check: GPUs usually sell for 20-40% of original price after 
24-30 months, with newer, in-demand models holding value better.  Understanding Your Results  
Scenario Values (the 4 boxes)  Scenario IRR/APR: Internal Rate of Return and Annual Percentage 
Yield—higher means better returns.  Scenario total earnings: Sum of all daily earnings over the 
service term after decay.  Scenario total return: Earnings plus residual value divided by purchase 
price. 1.0x means break even, 1.5x is 50% profit, and 2.0x means you doubled your money.  Scenario 
payback period: How many months until cumulative earnings equal purchase price. Faster is 
better—compare to your target ROI timeline.  Scenario Overview Chart  The graph shows three lines:  
Purchase price (dashed horizontal line)  Your initial investment—the baseline.  Revenue to-date 
(solid line)  How much you've actually earned so far (only appears if you selected one of your 
GPUs).  Scenario cumulative revenue (dashed line)  Projected total earnings over time based on your 
assumptions.  Key moments marked:   Where the graph line meets the purchase price line = payback 
period  End of line = service EOL   Common Questions  Q: Why doesn't my GPU's actual performance 
match the model?  A: The model is a projection based on assumptions. Reality has variability the 
smooth curve doesn't capture. If actual is trending way off, your assumptions (especially decay 
rate) might need adjusting.  Q: Should I use this to decide whether to buy a GPU?  A: Yes, but it's 
one input among many. Also consider: provider reputation, hardware availability, your risk 
tolerance, liquidity needs, and market trends.  Q: How do I estimate residual value?  A: Check 
secondary marketplaces for similar GPUs 18-24 months old. Generally 20-40% of original price. 
In-demand models hold value better.  Q: Can I save my scenarios?  A: Not currently. Take 
screenshots or note your assumptions. Copy the results into a spreadsheet for comparison.  Q: What 
if my assumptions change mid-ownership?  A: Run a new scenario with updated numbers and time 
remaining. The calculator doesn't "remember" past projections—each run is independent.  Reset  Made

 Pages Settings Settings  Manage your account details, security settings, organization memberships, 
and download monthly statements.  General Tab  Account profile and basic information management.  
Account Profile  Upload or remove your profile photo (accepted formats: JPG, PNG; max size: 5MB; 
recommended: 400x400px minimum). Set your first name and last name as the display name used 
throughout the platform. Your email is your primary contact—it must match your wallet-connected 
email. Click Save changes after making any modifications to persist updates.  Connections  Link 
external accounts for streamlined authentication. Connect Google or GitHub OAuth accounts for 
social sign-in—these accounts must use the same email address as your primary account email. If 
there's an email mismatch, you'll see: "Connected accounts must use the same address as your 
account email." Use this to sign in with Google instead of a password, verify identity through 
GitHub, and simplify future logins.  Security Tab  Manage authentication, password requirements, 
and account protection.  Change Password  Enter your current password for verification, then enter 
your new password and confirm it to prevent typos.  Password Requirements  All new passwords must 
have at least 10 characters (up to 100), at least one lowercase character, at least one special 
character (! @ # ?), and be significantly different from previous passwords. A requirements 
checklist shows which criteria are met as you type. If criteria aren't satisfied when attempting to 
save, you'll see a red warning: "Your new password must meet the requirements below."  Two-Factor 
Authentication  Add an additional security layer for account access. Google Authenticator is the 
recommended 2FA method using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP). Click Configure to open the 
setup flow for linking your authenticator app. This confirms your identity during unusual account 
activity or when accessing sensitive functions.  Passkeys  Modern authentication using biometric or 
device-based verification—hardware-backed cryptographic keys stored on your device (fingerprint, 
Face ID, security key). Use passkeys for secure asset transfers, sign-in authentication, and 
high-security actions.  Each passkey shows the platform (device type like iPhone, Windows, 
YubiKey), last used date, created date, and a delete option (X icon). Click Create a new passkey to 
initiate device-specific enrollment. Check the action log link to view history of all passkey usage 
and modifications.  Organizations Tab  Manage multi-signature wallets, DAOs, and group ownership 
structures.  Your Organizations  The table shows organization name, contract address (on-chain 
smart contract identifier), role (Admin with full management permissions or Member with view and 
limited interaction permissions), and date joined. Use the overflow menu (...) to access 
organization-specific actions like viewing details or leaving the organization.  Create 
Organization Button  Click to initiate the flow for deploying a new multi-sig or DAO 
structure—useful for forming GPU purchasing groups, creating investment DAOs, or establishing shared 
ownership structures.  Pending Invites  Each invite displays the organization name, timestamp

verification code to confirm, and save backup codes in a secure location.  Creating a Passkey: 
Navigate to Settings > Security, scroll to "Passkeys," click "Create a new passkey," follow 
browser/OS prompts, complete biometric or device verification, and the passkey appears in your list 
with its creation date.  Joining an Organization: Check your email for the organization invite, 
navigate to Settings > Organizations, find the invite in "Pending invites," review organization 
details (name, contract, inviter), click "Accept," sign the transaction if a wallet prompt appears, 
and the organization appears in "Your Organizations" table.  Downloading Statements: Navigate to 
Settings > Statements, select the desired month from the dropdown, click "Download," and the PDF 
saves to your default download location—open and verify contents.  Security Best Practices  Password 
Management: Use a unique password not used elsewhere, use a password manager to generate and store 
it, and change your password if account activity seems unusual. Don't share your password with 
anyone, use easily guessable patterns, or write it in an unsecured location.  2FA Setup: Enable 
immediately after account creation, store backup codes offline in a secure location, and use a 
dedicated authenticator app (Authy, 1Password). Don't skip 2FA setup, store backup codes in email, 
or disable 2FA unless absolutely necessary.  Passkey Management: Create passkeys for 
frequently-used devices, test passkey login before removing the password option, and keep a backup 
authentication method enabled. Don't create passkeys on shared or public devices, delete all 
passkeys without an alternative auth method, or share a device with active passkey access.  
Troubleshooting  "Connected accounts must use same email" Error: Trying to link Google or GitHub 
with a different email? Disconnect any existing linked accounts and update your primary account 
email to match the OAuth provider, then retry connection. Or change the email on your OAuth 
provider to match your Silicon account and retry connection.  Can't Change Password: If the "Save 
changes" button is disabled or you see red error text, verify your current password is correct, 
check the new password meets all requirements (review the checklist), ensure "new password" and 
"confirm password" fields match, and try clearing and re-entering.  Missing Organization: 
Organization not showing in the table after accepting the invite? Refresh the page, check pending 
invites (may need to re-accept), verify your wallet address matches the invite recipient, or 
contact the organization admin to resend the invite.  Statement Won't Download: If the download 
button isn't working or the file is corrupted, check your internet connection, try a different 
browser, clear your browser cache, disable ad blockers or extensions, and contact support if the 
issue persists.  Related Pages  Dashboard - Your portfolio overview  My GPUs - GPU management

earnings and operations   Understanding Your Role  As a datacenter provider on Silicon Network:  
You manage:   Physical GPU hardware and datacenter infrastructure  Vendor platform integrations 
(RunPod, Vast, Akash, etc.)  GPU-to-NFT pairing operations  Earning calculations and distribution 
to owners  Operational compliance and uptime  Owner communications and support   You facilitate:   
GPU rentals to compute customers  NFT minting and transfers to buyers  Regular payouts to GPU NFT 
owners  Secondary market sales between owners  Agreement signing and renewal   You don't control:   
NFT ownership (determined by blockchain)  Owner's ability to sell their GPUs  Secondary market 
pricing  Owner's withdrawal timing   GPU owners handle:   NFT ownership and transfers  Secondary 
market sales decisions  Earnings withdrawal to their wallets  Portfolio management   Key Concepts  
Tokenized GPU Infrastructure  Silicon Network enables fractional ownership of GPU infrastructure 
through NFTs. Each NFT represents one physical GPU unit hosted in your datacenter. Owners receive 
earnings while you maintain operational control.  Hardware Syncing  Connect your vendor platforms 
(RunPod, Vast, Akash, TensorDock, Shadeform) to automatically import GPU data, track earnings, and 
sync operational status. Manual imports are also supported via CSV.  Minting and Pairing  Minting 
creates the NFT on the blockchain. Pairing connects that NFT to a specific physical GPU in your 
inventory. GPUs must be paired to generate earnings for owners.  Two workflows:   Paired Minting : 
Mint NFT and immediately assign to a GPU (recommended for direct sales)  Unpaired Minting : Mint 
NFT first, pair to GPU later (useful for pre-sales or flexible inventory)   Multi-chain NFT Support 
 Silicon Network offers multi-chain NFT support to provide GPU access to as many blockchain 
ecosystems as possible. This approach ensures broader accessibility and enables ownership across 
different chains, including Base and Chia, with plans to expand to additional networks.  Provider 
Agreements  Owners must sign your provider agreement before GPUs can generate earnings. These 
agreements define:   Operational terms and responsibilities  Payout schedules and calculation 
methods  Hardware maintenance expectations  Termination conditions   Earnings Flow   GPU rented : 
Compute customer uses GPU capacity  Usage metered : Your vendor platform tracks rental 
time/resources  Data synced : Silicon imports earning data from vendor  Owner credited : Earning 
appears in owner's "Queued earnings"  Processed : Moved to owner's "Balance" during payout cycle  
Paid out : You transfer earnings to owner's wallet  Owner withdraws : Owner moves funds from 
platform to personal wallet   Payout Responsibility  As the provider, you're responsible for:   
Monitoring pending payouts in the Financials page  Initiating transfers to owners' wallets on 
schedule  Maintaining sufficient USDC liquidity for payouts  Tracking payout history and 
confirmations   Dashboard Overview  Active Alerts  The dashboard prominently shows critical 
operational issues:  GPUs Not Collecting Earnings : Identifies GPUs that haven't reported earnings 
recently. May indicate sync failures, offline hardware, unpairing issues, or vendor platform 
problems.  Action Required : Click "View GPUs" to see affected hardware and investigate root cause. 
 GPU Inventory Summary  Quick count of total GPUs by model type (H100, RTX 4090, etc.) across your 
entire operation.  Navigation Hub  Central access point to all provider functions: Hardware 
management, NFT operations, Owner relationships, Financial tracking, and Settings configuration.  
Common Workflows  Initial Setup (New Provider)   Configure your provider account in Settings  Add 
vendor integrations (RunPod, Vast, etc.)  Wait for initial hardware sync to complete  Review 
imported servers and GPUs in Hardware  Activate servers that will host tokenized GPUs  Create and 
publish your provider agreement  Mint NFTs for available GPUs (paired or unpaired)  Transfer NFTs 
to initial buyers  Wait for owners to sign agreements  Monitor Dashboard for operational alerts   
Daily Operations  Morning check (5 minutes):   Open Dashboard and review alerts  Check for GPUs not 
collecting earnings  Investigate and resolve any sync issues  Verify no pending agreement approvals 
  Weekly tasks (30 minutes):   Review Financials for pending payouts  Process payments to owners on 
schedule  Check vendor sync status in Hardware > Settings  Monitor owner communications and 
questions  Verify GPU utilization rates   Monthly responsibilities (1-2 hours):   Reconcile all 
owner payouts  Review and optimize vendor integrations  Audit GPU inventory and pairing status  
Check for unutilized or underperforming hardware  Review provider metrics and KPIs   Onboarding a 
New Owner   Owner purchases GPU NFT from you or secondary market  Owner's wallet address appears in 
Owners page  Owner receives prompt to sign your provider agreement  You receive notification when 
agreement is signed  Verify GPU is properly paired to NFT  Confirm GPU begins generating earnings  
Monitor earnings flow to owner's balance   Processing Payouts   Navigate to Financials > Owners tab 
 Review pending payouts by owner  Click "Pay" on individual owner or bulk process  Confirm 
transaction details and amounts  Sign blockchain transaction to transfer USDC  Wait for 
confirmation  Payout marked as complete in system  Owner can now withdraw to personal wallet   
Handling GPU Sales (Owner-to-Owner)  When an owner lists a GPU on the secondary market:   GPU 
remains operational and earning (no action needed)  Sale executes between owner wallets  New owner 
automatically appears in your Owners list  New owner must sign your provider agreement  Verify 
pairing remains intact after sale  Earnings automatically route to new owner   Minting New NFTs  
For immediate pairing (most common):   Navigate to Hardware > GPUs tab  Find unpaired GPU in 
inventory  Click three dots menu > "Mint NFT"  Select "Paired" minting option  Choose blockchain 
(Base or Chia)  Confirm transaction  NFT minted and immediately paired to GPU  Transfer NFT to 
buyer   For future pairing (bulk minting):   Navigate to NFTs page  Click "Mint NFTs"  Select 
quantity and GPU type  Choose blockchain  Confirm batch minting transaction  NFTs created in your 
wallet  Pair to specific GPUs later as needed   Hardware Management  Vendor Integrations  Silicon 
supports automatic syncing from:   RunPod : GPU cloud platform  Vast.ai : Distributed GPU 
marketplace  Akash Network : Decentralized cloud compute  TensorDock : GPU infrastructure provider  
Shadeform : Multi-cloud GPU aggregator   Each integration requires API credentials and sync 
configuration. See Importing Hardware for setup instructions.  Sync Monitoring  Hardware syncs run 
automatically on a schedule (typically hourly). Monitor sync status in Hardware > Settings > 
Vendors. Failed syncs trigger dashboard alerts and require investigation.  Common sync issues:   
API credentials expired or invalid  Vendor platform downtime  Rate limiting or throttling  Network 
connectivity problems   Server Activation  Control which servers participate in the tokenization 
program. Inactive servers and their GPUs won't appear in pairing workflows or generate earnings. 
Deactivating a server automatically unpairs all its GPUs.  NFT Operations  Token ID Management  
Every GPU NFT has a unique Token ID. Track Token IDs in the NFTs page and cross-reference with GPUs 
in the Hardware page. Token IDs appear on owner dashboards and blockchain explorers.  Pairing 
Status  GPUs can be:   Unpaired : No NFT assigned (cannot generate owner earnings)  Paired : 
Connected to specific NFT (earns for owner)  Transferred : NFT moved to new owner (pairing 
maintained)   Multi-chain Considerations  NFTs can be minted on Base or Chia networks. Each has 
different characteristics:   Base : EVM-compatible, faster finality, broader DeFi integration  Chia 
: Offer-based trading, lower fees, unique ownership model   Choose based on buyer preference and 
market liquidity.  Owner Management  Agreement Status  Track which owners have signed your provider 
agreement. Unsigned agreements block earnings—follow up with owners to complete this step.  
Communication  Maintain clear communication with owners about:   Payout schedules and timing  
Downtime or maintenance windows  Hardware upgrades or replacements  Performance issues or concerns  
Policy changes or updates   Performance Tracking  Owners monitor their GPU performance daily. 
Proactive communication about issues builds trust and reduces support burden.  Financial Operations 
 Earnings Calculation  Earnings are calculated based on:   Actual GPU rental time and usage  Vendor 
platform pricing and customer payments  Your provider fee structure (defined in agreements)  Any 
promotional adjustments or bonuses   Payout Processing  Best practices:   Process payouts on a

Verify all completed successfully     Quality check:   Cross-reference Hardware and NFTs pages  
Verify all pairings intact  Check earnings start tracking     Pairing Rules and Constraints  Type 
Matching  GPU type must match NFT type exactly: RTX 4090 NFT → RTX 4090 GPU only, H100 NVL NFT → H100 
NVL GPU only. Cannot pair mismatched types.  One-to-One Relationship  One NFT pairs to exactly one 
GPU, one GPU can have exactly one paired NFT, and this relationship persists until deliberately 
unpaired.  Availability Requirements  For successful pairing, the GPU must be imported and visible 
in Hardware, the server containing the GPU must be activated, the GPU cannot already be paired to 
another NFT, and the GPU type must match the NFT type.  Unpairing  Unpairing a GPU and NFT 
immediately ceases the NFT's earnings. Only unpair an Owner's GPU NFT if you have an immediate 
backup GPU to pair to their NFT.  Best Practices  Minting Strategy  Mint unpaired for pre-sales 
only to avoid excess inventory. Use paired minting for immediate sales to provide a better buyer 
experience. Verify owner addresses carefully as they cannot be changed after minting. Document all 
minting operations to maintain an audit trail.  Pairing Operations  Pair GPUs shortly after listing 
on compute marketplace to minimize revenue delays. Batch pair when possible for more efficient 
operations. Verify immediately after pairing to catch issues early and keep records synchronized by 
cross-checking Hardware and NFTs pages.  Quality Control  Monitor unpaired inventory to prevent 
unchecked growth. Track expected delivery dates and follow up on overdue hardware. Communicate with 
owners to keep them informed of pairing status.  Troubleshooting  NFT Not Appearing After Mint  
Check: Transaction confirmed on blockchain (SpaceScan for Chia, BaseScan for Base) with your 
Silicon wallet address, correct tab (Unpaired vs Paired), no active filters hiding NFT, and page 
refreshed recently.  Action: Wait 2-3 minutes and refresh, then check transaction hash on block 
explorer.  Can't Pair NFT  Check: Matching GPU type available, GPUs imported and servers activated, 
and GPU not already paired.  Action: See Troubleshooting  Pairing Completed But Not Showing  Check: 
Allow 2-3 minutes for confirmation, hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R), verify transaction on block 
explorer, and check both NFTs and Hardware pages.  Action: If still missing after 10 minutes, 
contact support@silicon.net  Integration with Other Pages  Hardware Connection  The Paired tab 
mirrors Hardware > GPUs data with changes in one reflecting in the other. The three dots menu 
allows you to edit pairing, list for sale, burn NFT, and view NFT. Server activation affects GPU 
pairing availability.  Owner Relationship  NFT count shows on owner profile, earnings track per 
NFT/GPU pair, and payouts process at owner level.  Financial Tracking  Each paired NFT generates 
earnings with revenue tracked in the Financials section, payouts processed per owner, and 
transaction history maintained.  Monitoring NFT Health  Daily Checks  Review any new unpaired NFTs, 
verify recent pairings completed, and check for pairing errors or alerts.  Weekly Review  Audit 
unpaired inventory, confirm all expected pairings done, and cross-reference with the Hardware page. 
 Monthly Reconciliation  Count total NFTs (paired + unpaired) and match against GPU inventory.

30-day payouts. Click "Transfer" to add funds.  Next 30D Payouts: Estimated payouts for next 30 
days based on current earnings data. As a critical part of cash flow planning, this metric updates 
daily.  Gross Earnings: Total revenue generated by all GPUs before owner payouts  Payouts to 
Owners: Total amount paid to GPU owners. Will lag behind earnings by approx. 30 days as earnings 
need to age to account for chargebacks and finalization.  Net Earnings: Gross earnings minus owner 
payouts—your revenue after obligations. Includes platform fees (if applicable).  Charts and 
Visualizations  Earnings Over Time: Track revenue trends and identify patterns. Filter by date 
range (daily, weekly, monthly views) to see both daily and cumulative earnings while identifying 
seasonal trends across your filtered dataset.  Average Gross Card Earnings: Compare performance 
across GPU types using percentile views (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th). Filter by GPU type (RTX

Performance Indicators  Financial Health  Wallet Balance Ratio: Target ≥ 1.5x next 30D payouts 
(Warning: < 1.2x, Critical: < 1.0x).  Gross Earnings Growth: Track month-over-month percentage 
growth against capacity additions (Target: positive growth).  Payout Ratio: Owner payouts divided 
by gross earnings, typically 60-80%. Higher ratios mean more goes to owners, lower ratios mean more 
provider revenue.  Net Margin: Net earnings divided by gross earnings. Target depends on your 
business model—monitor trend over time and optimize through efficiency.  Operational Efficiency  
Average Earnings per GPU: Track by type (4090, 5090, H100), compare to benchmarks month-over-month, 
and use to guide procurement decisions.  Utilization Rate: GPUs earning divided by total GPUs 
(Target: > 95%). Track daily and address gaps quickly.  Payment Timeliness: Percentage of payouts 
processed on schedule (Target: 100%). Track failures and delays to maintain owner trust.  
Troubleshooting  Earnings Don't Match Vendor  Check: Date range alignment, time zone differences, 
sync status, and whether you're comparing gross vs net figures.  Action: Cross-reference specific 
GPUs, verify sync status, and contact support if there's a large discrepancy.  Missing Transactions 
 Check: Date filter settings, transaction type filters, whether the page has refreshed recently, 
and network confirmation status.  Action: Clear all filters, refresh the page, and check the block 
explorer if transactions are still missing.  Incorrect Payout Totals  Check: Time period 
calculation accuracy, whether all GPUs are included, if recent pairings are reflected, and data 
sync completion status.  Action: Review individual GPU earnings, verify totals in the Earnings tab, 
and recalculate manually to identify discrepancies.  Best Practices  Data Management  Export data 
monthly as a minimum retention requirement, maintain multiple backups in both cloud and local 
storage, organize files by month and year, and document any anomalies with explanations for 
deviations.  Cash Flow  Maintain a buffer of 1.5x upcoming payouts minimum, monitor balance daily 
every morning, and schedule top-ups before running low.  Reporting  Establish a regular cadence 
(weekly internal, monthly external), focus on key metrics without overwhelming stakeholders with 
data, include trend analysis to show change over time, and provide context to explain significant 
changes.  Compliance  Retain records for 7+ years to meet tax and legal requirements, record all 
blockchain transaction hashes, maintain owner records that match 1099 requirements (if applicable), 
and keep a complete and accessible audit trail.  Integration with Other Pages  Hardware Connection  
Earnings are tracked per GPU with GPU IDs linking to the Hardware page. Performance data is 
synchronized in real-time across both pages.  Owners Connection  Payout data feeds from earnings 
data, owner information is synchronized across both pages, and payment processing updates reflect 
in both views for consistency.  NFTs Connection  Earnings are tied to paired NFTs with token IDs 
referenced in transactions. Owner payments follow NFT ownership, and pairing status impacts earning 
tracking.  Related Guides  Monitoring your financials - Complete monitoring guide | Paying owners -

 Best Practices Best Practices  Operational guidelines for running a successful GPU provider 
operation on Silicon Network.  Hardware Management  Vendor Data Synchronization  Sync vendor data 
daily via Hardware > Settings   Monitor sync status every morning  Address sync failures within 6 
hours  Rotate API keys quarterly for security   Why it matters: Stale data leads to inaccurate 
earnings reporting and owner complaints.  Performance Monitoring  Investigate any GPU showing no 
earnings for an unexpected amount of time  24-hour checklist:   Verify GPU still deployed on vendor 
platform  Check NFT pairing intact  Confirm server activation status  Review vendor platform alerts 
  48-hour checklist:   Contact vendor support  Check hardware status  Review rental demand for GPU 
type   72+ hours:   Communicate with affected owner  Document issue and resolution   NFT Operations 
 Minting Strategy  Mint unpaired NFTs for pre-sales only   Avoid creating excess unpaired inventory 
 Track expected hardware delivery dates  Communicate delivery timelines to buyers  Have pairing 
plan before minting   Why it matters: Unpaired NFTs don't generate earnings, leading to buyer 
dissatisfaction.  Pairing Timeliness  Pair NFTs within 24 hours of provisioning and rental on a 
vendor platform   Prepare pairing details in advance  Batch pair when possible for efficiency  
Verify successful pairing immediately  Confirm earnings begin tracking   Impact: Every day unpaired 
= lost revenue for owners and reputation risk for you.  Financial Management  Wallet Balance 
Maintenance  Maintain wallet balance of at least 1.5x upcoming 30-day payouts  Monitoring schedule: 
  Daily: Check balance vs upcoming payouts  Weekly: Top up if below threshold  Monthly: Review 
buffer adequacy   Why 1.5x ?   Accounts for payout growth between top-ups  Provides buffer for 
urgent payments  Maintains payment reliability reputation   Payment Schedules  Pay owners on 
consistent schedule (weekly/monthly)  Weekly payments:   Pros: Predictable cash flow, happier 
owners  Cons: More admin time  Best for: Smaller operations (<100 GPUs)   Bi-weekly payments:   
Pros: Balance of frequency and efficiency  Cons: Requires clear communication  Best for: Mid-size 
operations (100-500 GPUs)   Monthly payments:   Pros: Lowest transaction costs, simplified 
accounting  Cons: Longer wait for owners, requires larger balance  Best for: Large operations (500+ 
GPUs)   Whatever schedule you choose, communicate it clearly and stick to it consistently.  Record

metrics.  Community Providers  Individual GPU owners who contribute underutilized computing 
resources from consumer-grade hardware. Community Providers extend the network beyond traditional 
datacenters, primarily supporting inference workloads with lower latency requirements. Their 
participation creates a more resilient, distributed network while enabling individuals with gaming 
GPUs or workstations to generate passive income through the Silicon Network protocol. Later, these 
community providers will have the ability to grow by issuing GPU NFTs to their own buyers, and 
become Verified Providers.  Compute Customers  AI companies, researchers, and developers who 
consume GPU compute for training, fine-tuning, and inference workloads. Compute Customers gain 
access to enterprise-grade GPU resources without capital expenditure or long-term commitments. The 
marketplace's flexible consumption models enable them to optimize for cost, performance, or 
reliability based on specific workload requirements, significantly reducing the barriers to AI 
innovation.  Compute Brokers  Specialized marketplace platforms that match compute supply with 
demand through streamlined provider networks. Compute Brokers enable efficient discovery, 
deployment, and management of compute resources through standardized specifications and seamless 
deployment tools. Their participation enhances market efficiency by creating essential connection 
points between datacenter providers and customers seeking appropriate resources.  Platform

 litepaper Tokenomics Tokenomics  Silicon Network's token economy is designed to align incentives 
across all ecosystem participants while providing a stable foundation for the network's long-term 
growth. This section provides a high-level overview of the token model, with comprehensive details 
that will be available in a Silicon Network tokenomics whitepaper.  Tokenized GPU Ownership  GPU 
NFTs represents ownership of physical computing hardware, combining the benefits of real-world 
assets with blockchain-based transferability:   Each physical GPU in a datacenter will have an NFT 
on Chia that represents ownership of the GPU to claim rewards, and a corresponding Base NFT that 
will be used for initial capital formation as well as be used to define where rewards payouts are 
sent  Owners can claim rewards based on their GPU's utilization or can opt into resource pools for 
smoothed, predictable earnings across multiple GPUs  Performance metrics and ownership records are 
transparently tracked on-chain  NFTs can be traded on Silicon Network's marketplace   $SIL Token 
Overview  $SIL functions as the native utility token of the Silicon Network, serving three 
essential purposes and will be available on both Base and Chia blockchains:   Payment Mechanism: 
Facilitates transactions within the ecosystem  Reward Distribution: Compensates GPU owners and 
operators for contributing resources  Governance: Enables protocol decision-making by token holders 
  A total fixed supply of $SIL will be generated across both Base, a layer 2 optimistic rollup on 
Ethereum, and the Chia blockchain to serve as native tokens on both chains. The native tokens will 
be interchangeable between the two chains through Silicon's cross-chain transfer protocol (CCTP), a 
fork of Circle's CCTP for swapping USDC across blockchains.  Economic Model Summary on Base  On 
Base, Silicon Network employs a Burn-Mint Equilibrium (BME) model that creates price stability for 
users while rewarding infrastructure providers building an economic flywheel that balances supply 
and demand:   Customer payments in $SIL are burned to create USD-pegged data credits ($DC)  
Spending $DC for compute resources provides stable pricing  $DCs spent to a GPU or pool GPUs 
represent the utilization of those GPUs that will earn $SIL within a given time epoch  $SIL is 
minted as rewards proportional to resource utilization when $DC are burned over a epoch and 
ultimately distributed to both GPU owners and providers while a small fee is paid to the Silicon 
Protocol foundation wallet to maintain the network  Proof of ownership of NFT to a specific GPU 
entitles the owner to claim $SIL rewards   Economic Model Summary on Chia  Silicon Network's will 
have a portion of the total supply minted as a native token on Chia to incentive participation by 
the Chia farming community to participate in a worldwide distributed AI inference cloud platform:   
$SIL on Chia will be used by inference customers to access and use the Silicon Community Cloud 
Provider network  Community cloud providers will be paid in $SIL on Chia as rewards for processing 
AI inference workloads based on the market price token cost to run the inference workload  
Marketplace price for inference customers will be initially be set by Berkeley Compute based on 
market rates that will eventually move to an oracle that will determine the exchange rate for $SIL 
to compute tokens needed to pay for each inference workload  $SIL on Chia can be swapped to $SIL on 
Base and vice versa through Silicon's cross chain transfer protocol   Cross Chain Transfer Protocol 
 Silicon Network will deploy a cross chain transfer protocol to ensure a 1 for 1 swap of $SIL 
across all supported blockchains to keep the total supply of $SIL fixed while allowing the 
flexibility for users to collect, and spend $SIL on their preferred blockchains and use case:   
Smart contracts on Chia and on Base enable burning and minting of SIL on a 1:1 basis  Holders can 
move $SIL seamlessly between Base and Chia or any other future supported blockchains at a 1:1 swap 
eliminating needs to have a wrapped or synthetic tokens  Enhanced security due to a burn-mint 
mechanism that ensures the native token is only minted on the destination chain  Easily supports 
the addition of $SIL on new blockchains to access other highly liquid or strategic communities  
Removes reliance on liquidity pools and third party liquidity providers enabling limitless 
transfers without requiring locked liquidity while minimizing fees with no slippage   Token 
Allocation  The $SIL token distribution on Base and Chia is strategically designed to foster 
long-term ecosystem growth and align incentives across all stakeholders:   Early Node Incentives: 
Allocation reserved for early GPU operators who support network growth  Community & Ecosystem: 
Funds dedicated to community development, grants, and ecosystem expansion  Foundation Treasury: 
Resources maintained by the foundation for long-term governance and sustainability  Team & 
Contributors: Allocation for the development team and early contributors with appropriate vesting 
schedules  Strategic Partners: Tokens dedicated to building strategic relationships with key 
industry participants   Specific allocation percentages and vesting schedules are detailed in a 
forthcoming Silicon Network tokenomics whitepaper. Our Solution Roadmap
